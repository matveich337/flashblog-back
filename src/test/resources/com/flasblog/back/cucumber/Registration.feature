  As an Un-registered User of the application
  I want to validate the Registration functionality
  In order to check if it works as desired

  Background: User navigates to Registration page
    Given I navigate to the "Registration" page

  @SuccessfulRegistration
  Scenario Outline: Successful Registration using valid credentials
    When I fill in "username" with "<username>"
    And I fill in "email" with "<email>"
    And I fill in "password" with "<password>"
    And I fill in "confirmPassword" with "<confirmPassword>"
    And I click on the "Register" button
    Then I should be successfully registered
    Examples:

    And I fill in "confirmPassword" with "<confirmPassword>"
    And I click on the "Register" button
